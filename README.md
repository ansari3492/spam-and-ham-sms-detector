# spam-and-ham-sms-detect
The purpose of this Project is to explore the results of applying machine learning techniques to detect Message spam detection.
SMS spam (sometimes called cell phone spam) is any junk message delivered to a mobile phone as text messaging through the Short
Message Service (SMS). The dataset for this project originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Mobile phone spam also known as (unsolicited messages, especially advertising), directed at the text
messaging or other communications services of mobile phones or smartphones. Fighting SMS spam is complicated
by several factors (compared to Internet email), including the lower rate of SMS spam, which has allowed many
users and service providers to ignore the issue, and the limited availability of mobile phone spam-filtering software.

Use different approaches to establish relation between the text and the category SPAM or HAM like, based on
size of message, word count, special keywords. Then build classification models using different techniques 
to distinguish spam sms. Compare accuracy of each technique and plot the accuracy graphs in a single bar plot.
Also generate a word-cloud for spam SMS. Sample spam word cloud generated
and also use a flask framework with the html page link you entered any message in the text box and click  on submit button and then you go on the flask server http://localhost:3000/check this project is interesting
